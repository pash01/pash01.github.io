		<h1> Paulina Ash's Biography </h1>
	<body>
		<p> My name is Paulina Ash, and I am 21 years old. I was born on September 2nd, 1996 in Chicago, IL and went to Solomon Schechter Day School through 8th grade. I have a younger brother, who is an 18 year old sophomore at University of Illinois, and I have three step siblings (two step-sisters and one step-brother). Growing up, I was a figure skater, and throughout high school I worked as a figure skating coach for young children. I was also very involved in my local Jewish community. I attended Camp Young Judaea for seven summers and later served on the student board for the Midwest region as the Administrative Vice President. Additionally, I volunteered at a Jewish organization called Friendship Circle, where I worked with children with special needs. During high school, I also worked as an English Tutor in the Reading and Writing Center. </p>
		<p> After graduating from New Trier High School (in Winnetka, IL), I spent the summer before college working at Camp Young Judaea Midwest, the overnight summer camp I had attended as a camper. I worked as an in-bunk counselor for 13 and 14 year old girls, as well as on the waterfront as a lifeguard. I continued to work at Camp Young Judaea Midwest for two summers after that. During my last summer there, I worked on the supervisory staff as the Waterfront Director. I oversaw a staff of lifeguards to ensure that safe and meaningful programming was happening on the waterfront, and I worked with a group of supervisors to oversee camp as a whole. </p>
		<p> I am currently a senior at Tufts University, in Medford, MA. Throughout my time at Tufts I have been very involved in Tufts Hillel. I served on the student board for a year and interned for a student group called Tufts Against Genocide for another year. I am currently the Student President for Tufts Hillel. I work to make sure that all things related to Hillel are running smoothly, I oversee the student board who works on Hillel programming, and I engage community members both inside and outside of the Hillel community. At Tufts, I am majoring in Psychology and minoring in Computer Science and Hebrew. I am also a pre-med student and am interested in going to medical school in the next few years.
